# Given a string, return a new string where the first and last chars have been exchanged.

# front_back('code') → 'eodc'
# front_back('a') → 'a'
# front_back('ab') → 'ba'

def front_back(str):
  if len(str) <= 1:
    return str
  return str[-1] + str[1:-1] + str[0]

# Explanation:
# If the string has only one character (len(s) <= 1), return it as is.
# Otherwise, swap the first (s[0]) and last (s[-1]) characters while keeping the middle part (s[1:-1]) unchanged.
